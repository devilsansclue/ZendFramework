1. Implement Doctrine\DBAL\Driver
2. Let your database driver implement: Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\Connection
3. Let your database driver statement implement: Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\Statement
4. Your driver only needs the features that the wrapper Doctrine\DBAL\Connection requires, this is:
    prepare($query);
    exec($query);
    quote($input, $type);
    lastInsertId($seqName=null);
    beginTransaction();
    commit();
    rollBack();
5. Your statement needs to implement the complete interface Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\Statement
